I have built a mobile app called Stock Markets - AI Insights. It has the following features from a high level. I have also attached many screenshots of the app to give you an idea about the look and feel and the colors. Based on all this I want you to create a modern looking website for my app's web presence. It should be a totally front end based website, I do not want something very complex where I need an extensive backend to power the website.
